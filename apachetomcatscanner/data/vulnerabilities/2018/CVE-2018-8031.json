    "description": "The Apache TomEE console (tomee-webapp) has a XSS vulnerability which could allow javascript to be executed if the user is given a malicious URL. This web application is typically used to add TomEE features to a Tomcat installation. The TomEE bundles do not ship with this application included. This issue can be mitigated by removing the application after TomEE is setup (if using the application to install TomEE), using one of the provided pre-configured bundles, or by upgrading to TomEE 7.0.5. This issue is resolve in this commit: b8bbf50c23ce97dd64f3a5d77f78f84e47579863."
